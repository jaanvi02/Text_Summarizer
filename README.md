# Flask Text Summarizer Web App

This application employs a straightforward extractive Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique to generate summaries from English language text. Users can input any text they desire, and the app will provide a summary tailored to their preferred length. Additionally, users have the flexibility to specify the language of the input text and receive the summary in their desired language.
